Onboarding T\&C's Association articles

## Summary

## Purpose of the building block

This building block's purpose is to guide organisations on what to do when they want to start sharing data according to the BDI on a governance level. Things need to be considered to ensure that sharing data is done securely according to laws and regulations and in a way in which other BDI participants agree. These governance aspects form the basis for BDI participants to join and form the first layer of conformity. Participants that will share data according to the BDI framework must either join an association

## Concepts

Association Governance

Adopted from DSSC; [Organisational Form and Governance Authority - Blueprint v1.0 - Data Spaces Support Centre (dssc.eu)](https://dssc.eu/space/BVE/357074549/Organisational+Form+and+Governance+Authority)

Every data-sharing initiative needs bodies to create, maintain, and enforce its governance framework and manage the data space’s day-to-day operations In the case of the BDI, this is called an association. It effectively runs the association daily.

The legal and natural persons that established a data space can determine the competencies of the governance authority within the limits of the law (e.g. rules on competencies of the executive, rules on the representation of the data space in dealings with third parties, rules on the creation of working groups and committees).

### Onboarding

New members of an association need to be vetted to ensure the integrity of its members and the used systems. The following aspects must be taken into consideration:

· vetting the organization

· checking roles the organization wants to be able to fulfil

· verifying credentials, certificates (trust chain)

· making sure legal contracts are signed by functionaries with a mandate (trust chain)

· verifying if the IT applications they use are compliant and secure (conformity tests)

Other members rely on the association administration entity to fulfil this role correctly. The result of onboarding is an entry in the Association Register.

All changes to the registrations stored in the Association Register must follow the process outlined in this section: this process reduces the possibility of attack vectors directed to the staff of the Association Administration (social engineering, blackmail etc.)

The following steps apply to new registrations, updates to registrations and depreciation.

| Prepare       | <p>A complete set of attributes is prepared; for updates, this includes all data in the registration (including any attributes that haven't changed).</p><p>During preparation attributes can be added, removed and modified freely. Ideally, there is a way to validate the dataset during preparation but it must be possible to work with intermediate/incomplete data until submitting for verification.</p>                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| ------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Verify        | <p>Verification is an automated process.</p><p>Once, submitted for verification it is kept immutable; it must not be possible to change datasets during or after verification. If changes have to be made they will be fully re-submittedS and follow the full prepare / verify/commit process.</p><p>Once the verification stage is completed, it can be queued for commit.</p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| Commit & Sign | <p>Once verified, the Association Functionary who will also do any non-automated checks, for instance checking the (digital) signature on any signed documents provided.</p><p>The Association Functionary cannot change the submission. The only possible actions are "reject" or "commit" or “deprecate” an already committed.</p><p>It is a requirement that non-repudiation of the action taken by the Association Functionary is supported.</p><p>Only a commit will add/update / modify the registration in the Association Register. If changes are not committed, they do not affect the Register.</p> |

### Terms and Conditions

“adopted from DSSC; [Contractual framework - Blueprint v1.0 - Data Spaces Support Centre (dssc.eu)](https://dssc.eu/space/BVE/357074870/Contractual+framework) ”

Terms and Conditions define and specify a limited number of predefined and standardised contractual clauses and/or licenses that data providers should use (use case/data product level). It could specify the terms and conditions by which all data space participants entering into a data transaction would need to abide by, providing common governance to data transactions and ensuring respect for the applicable legislation (regulatory compliance).

In other words, the T\&Cs allow to introduce common elements (e.g., standardised clauses) and legal effects to the organisational and business decisions applicable. It may limit the freedom of action that a participant has about data transaction agreement, however reducing transaction costs and complexity, and increasing legal interoperability. Furthermore, BDI allows for changes in the T\&Cs as long as they still adhere to the included rules and regulations.

Regulatory compliance

“adopted from DSSC; [Regulatory Compliance - Blueprint v1.0 - Data Spaces Support Centre (dssc.eu)](https://dssc.eu/space/BVE/357074696/Regulatory+Compliance)”

Regulatory compliance encompasses a range of activities designed to ensure that the relevant regulatory frameworks are adhered to, and is an ongoing practice throughout the lifecycle of the data space. These activities include embedding various elements and functions of the data space within the regulatory landscape, guiding the Data Space Governance Authority and participants on the relevance of EU values and different regulations, addressing roles and responsibilities among participants, creating internal policies for regulatory compliance, and continuously monitoring compliance throughout the life cycle of a data space.

## Implementation Considerations

**Membership, onboarding and offboarding procedures:**

o Define clear criteria for admission and continued participation.

o Develop efficient onboarding processes, including establishing general terms and conditions and reviewing participant compliance.

o Plan for efficient offboarding processes to manage the exit of participants while safeguarding data and maintaining the integrity of the data space.

· Participant categories and roles:

o Identify and categorise participants according to their role in a data space.

o Define specific roles for participants, such as data providers, data recipients, and data rights holders.

o Establish clear application rules for different participant categories.

**Mechanisms for inclusive data governance:**

o The aim is to promote consultation between participants in decision-making and encourage active engagement and contributions from all stakeholders in the governance of the BDI-association. While the realisation of this objective may vary between different BDI-associations, the overarching intention within the common European data spaces is to challenge traditional hierarchical models and take a more inclusive and collaborative approach to governance.

o By fostering inclusivity, participants can benefit from different perspectives, ensure fairness and build a sense of collective ownership of governance rules, ultimately promoting trust and effective operation.

o Achieving this inclusivity requires the involvement of various stakeholders in decision-making, including representatives from the private and public sectors. This inclusiveness may already be reflected in the composition of the governance authority, but if it's not, the governance authority should provide opportunities for stakeholders to review or contribute to the governance framework.

o Encourage transparency and engagement to build a sense of collective ownership and commitment among participants.

**Data sovereignty and security measures:**

o Address data sovereignty concerns to ensure participants maintain control over their data and services.

o Specify security measures to protect data within the data space, considering factors like critical infrastructure and adherence to standards.
