# Authorisation (Oauth 2.0), AR-DM + XACML policies

## Summary&#x20;

## Purpose of the building block

This building block describes how parties can use the BDI to assess the other party involved in a (data) transaction and, based on the assessment, decide whether or not to go through with the transaction.&#x20;

## Concepts&#x20;

The following concepts (from the BDI Glossary) are particularly relevant in this building block:&#x20;

<table><thead><tr><th width="207">Concept</th><th>Meaning</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Data Owner </td><td><ul><li>Has control over data and access to data,   </li><li>Controls decisions on Data Sovereignty and Trust Sovereignty  </li><li>Controls authorisation policies, representation rules, professional qualification verification of staff and contactors    </li><li>Controls subscription to the Event Pub/Sub Service, and publishing of events to subscribers  </li><li>Controls discovery and endpoints  </li><li>Controls roles assumed by entity </li></ul></td></tr><tr><td>Data Consumer </td><td><ul><li>Requests access to data and/or Representation Register and/or Professional Qualification Register of the Data Owner  </li><li>Controls discovery and endpoints  </li><li>Requests subscription to Event Pub/Sub Service of the Data Owner, receives and evaluates events  </li></ul></td></tr><tr><td>Data Service Provider </td><td><ul><li>A Service Provider that acts under supervision and on behalf of the Data Owner </li></ul></td></tr></tbody></table>

Information from these building blocks is used in this building block to make a decision on Authorization.

## Elements and their key functions&#x20;

While entering into a transaction, each participant involved in the transaction will decide if that party trusts the other party.&#x20;

To make a decision on trust, the party will use relevant and available information. The BDI provides a framework for four input elements for this decision:

1. [Trust based on the membership of an Association](authorisation-oauth-2.0-ar-dm-+-xacml-policies.md#id-1.-trust-based-on-association-membership), one of it’s parent Associations or the root BDI Network.
2. [Trust based on the level of assurance](authorisation-oauth-2.0-ar-dm-+-xacml-policies.md#id-2.-trust-based-on-the-level-of-assurance-of-the-digital-identity-of-the-party) of the digital identity of the party.
3. [Trust based on the reputation of the Member](authorisation-oauth-2.0-ar-dm-+-xacml-policies.md#id-2.-trust-based-on-reputations) as provided by the Reputation Model.
4. [Trust based on (granular) Authorizations](authorisation-oauth-2.0-ar-dm-+-xacml-policies.md#id-3.-trust-based-on-authorisations) provided by a Data Owner.

### Trust in case of a Data Service Provider acting on behalf of a Data Owner

A specific situation occurs when a Data Service Provider acts on behalf of a Data Owner. The Data Service Provider is assumed to have a business relationship with a Data Owner in which the rules for sharing data on behalf of the Data Owner are established. Beside the input elements that can be provided using the BDI Framework, a Data Service Provider and Data Owner can agree on other inputs used to make a trust decision.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Example of a Data Service Provider**

Consider the situation where a Data Service Provider is being requested for data by a Data Consumer. The Data Service Provider could use the following information in its decision to trust the Data Consumer:

* Is the Data Consumer member of my Association, a parent Association or the root BDI Network? \[BDI input element 1]
* What is the reputation of the Data Consumer? \[BDI input element 3]
* Can the Data Consumer provide Authorizations given to him by a Data Owner? \[BDI input element 4]
* Is the Data Consumer a legal entity based in the EU? \[specific criterium, which can optionally be encapsulated in the (granular) Authorization \[BDI input element 4] as a condition

Based on both this information and the nature of the data that the Data Service Provider is requested for (for instance the confidentiality or privacy aspects), the Data Service Provider can make a business decision to provide or not provide the data.
{% endhint %}

## Core design decisions

The four inputs for decision making are supported by the BDI trust input elements as follows.

### 1. Trust based on association membership

#### Information gathering

This input element uses input from the building block [authentication.md](authentication.md "mention"). This building block provides insight into what association and (optionally) what parent associations a participant is a member of.

#### Information processing

To facilitate easier processing of the acquired information, a party can:

* Choose to follow Association business logic, in this case the Association has defined how to translate Association membership into trust levels.
* (If allowed by the Association) choose to follow it's own logic.&#x20;

### 2. Trust based on the level of assurance of the digital identity of the party

#### Information gathering

This input element uses input from the building block [authentication.md](authentication.md "mention"). This building block provides insight into the level of assurance of the party.

#### Information processing

To facilitate easier processing of the acquired information, a party can:

* Choose to follow Association business logic, in this case the Association has defined how to translate Association membership into trust levels.
* (If allowed by the Association) choose to follow it's own logic.&#x20;

### 3. Trust based on reputations

#### Information gathering

The [business-partner-reputation-model.md](business-partner-reputation-model.md "mention") forms the basis for acquiring reputation information. It is not yet defined how information on reputation of a party can be acquired.

#### Information processing

Assuming that information on the reputation of a party is available, a party can:

* Choose to follow Association business logic.
* (If allowed by the Association) choose to follow it's own logic.&#x20;

### 4. Trust based on (granular) Authorisations

Authorisations provide a way for a Data Owner to specify in great detail which Data  Consumer is allowed to consume data on its behalf at a Data Service Provider. From a data sovereignty perspective, Authorisations provide the highest level of 'trust' and best basis to enter into a transaction up, when transactions are happening between Service Consumers and Data Service Providers.

#### Information gathering

In terms of the technical specifications for Authorisations, the BDI Framework builds on the iSHARE Trust Framework. The iSHARE Trust Framework uses the term “delegations” for the concept that in BDI is called Authorisations.&#x20;

* The framework defines [the role of an Authorisation Registry](https://framework.ishare.eu/is/framework-and-roles)&#x20;
* Entitled Parties are enabled in exercising data sovereignty by providing delegations (as described in the [generic use cases](https://framework.ishare.eu/is/use-cases)) to parties to use their data&#x20;
* [Licenses](https://framework.ishare.eu/is/licenses) specify the legal boundaries for the usage of data by a Data Consumer
* The [structure of delegation](https://framework.ishare.eu/is/structure-of-delegation-evidence) evidence is defined in the framework and the technical requirements for APIs providing delegation evidence on the [iSHARE Developer Portal](https://dev.ishare.eu/).&#x20;

All mentioned iSHARE requirements must be considered as BDI requirements.&#x20;

Functionally authorisations can:

* Be provided by the Data Consumer when requesting to consume a service at a Data Service Provider.
* Be requested by the Data Service Provider when a Data Consumer requests to consumer a service.

iSHARE and therefore BDI do not define in what way an Authorisation Registry needs to store policies regarding delegations.

### Guidance for trust decision making

It could be helpful to create a trust decision matrix, to improve manageability of decision rules. The approach would be:

1. To classify data with a required assurance level (for instance low, medium, high).
2. To assign required trust levels to an assurance level.

This could be done at a party's level or at an Association's level.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
**Example of data classification**

Location of a container -> low

Contents of a container -> medium

Personal data of shipper -> high
{% endhint %}

Example of a trust decision matrix:

<table data-full-width="true"><thead><tr><th>Classification</th><th>Association trust required</th><th>Reputation trust required</th><th>Granular authorisation required</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Low</td><td>Medium</td><td>No</td><td>No</td></tr><tr><td>Medium</td><td>Medium</td><td>Medium</td><td>No</td></tr><tr><td>High</td><td>High</td><td>High</td><td>Yes</td></tr></tbody></table>

Business rules could also consist of a combination of the varius trust aspects. For instance that either medium association trust OR medium reputation trust is required.

### Future topics

* For improved discoverability of the parents of a BDI Association, the BDI Association Register could be improved by returning this information for every party lookup directly as part of the party information.
* To improve interoperability between associations, BDI might consider to define standardised rules for service/data classification and a best-practice approach for trust processing.
