An Identity Broker allows Data Consumer to select the Identity Provider they prefer to authenticate themselves at. It prevents the need for a direct relationship between all Data Service Providers and all Identity Providers.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

Depending on parameters such as the quality of the registration process, quality of credentials, use of biometrics or multiple authentication factors and information security, an authentication protocol can provide a server with a high or low confidence in the claimed identity of the client. For low-interest products, a low certainty might be sufficient, while for sensitive data it is essential that a server is confident that the client's claimed identity is valid.</p><p><br></p> |
